[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Calama/kale.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Calama/kale)

A convenient superclass and some helpers for stuff you want to keep in mongodb.


**Note**: The master branch should be considered unstable. Releases are tagged,
so checkout a tag or use a release published on pypi for production.


Motivation
----------

PyMongo is awesome. Object-oriented data through model classes is awesome. kale
tries to bridge those two, and get out of your way.


### Why not just use PyMongo?

You should! It's awesome, and perfectly useable stand-alone. It keeps you
connected to your data, and to mongo itself, and I think that's important.

Kale does not try to stand as a layer to hide PyMongo from you. It simply
changes a couple things around to make more sense in the Model paradigm, and
give you something consistent to build your models on. It extends PyMongo.


### blah blah blah

about the paradigm, why I don't like other ORMs. explicit++; schema
validation--.


Quick, Start!
-------------

This is not a tutorial on PyMongo. There's a decent chance that PyMongo alone
is enough for you. Start there.

kale provides you with a base class for your own models. This base class
subclasses python's `dict`, so it can be directly saved to Mongo.

You need to define two things in your models:

 1. `_collection_name`, a string specifying the collection where instances of
    your models should be saved to and loaded from.

 2. '_database', a PyMongo database instance.

Your model will be provided with four attributes you should know about:

 1. `Model.save`,
 2. `Model.insert`,
 3. `Model.remove`: These functions map
    almost directly to `PyMongo`'s `Collection.save`, etc. However, they are
    inteded for use on _instances of your model_. So you don't need to pass
    anything to them. If you have an instance of something, you can just call
    `save()` on it, and it'll be saved.

 4. `Model.collection`: This attribute gives you a special version of
    `PyMongo`'s `Collection` object, tied to the model's collection (specified
    with `Model._collection_name`!). The special part is that any documents
    retrieved from mongo will be instantiations of the Model.

    The `Model.collection.raw()` method will give you access to `PyMongo`'s
    `Collection` for the model, unaltered.


Notes
-----

 * Collection-level operations are accessible though the `.collection`,
   eg. `MyModel.collection.find_one()`.

 * All documents returned through the collection will be instantiated as
   models. To get the raw json document, use `raw()`, eg.
   `MyModel.collection.raw().find_one()`.

 * Document-level operations are ported down directly to the model, eg.
   `MyModel().save()`. The model's `_id` will be passed in where appropriate.

 * There is no model-level `update`, since it clashes with `dict`'s `update`.
   Use `save`, or `Model.collection.update(instance, ...)`.

 * The model-level `remove` is restricted to only remove the model's document.

 * No special ref support... yet.

 * Feedback and tests welcome!

 * Kale does its best to cast dicts to `kale.AttrDict` recursively when you
   instantiate a `kale.Model`, but it can't do magic -- If you do
   `my_model_instance.listproperty.append({'some': 'dict'})`, it will be a
   dict, not an `AttrDict`. However, if a document with this structure is
   retrieved from the database, `dict`s in iterables _will_ be cast to
   `AttrDict`s (as of v0.2.1).


Changelog
---------

### v0.3

 * Added live-instance registry that ensure only one instance of a document's
   model exists in the program.
 * Added `collectionmethod` decorator.


### v0.2.2
 * fix some casting stuff

### v0.2.1

 * bugfix for casting dicts in iterables to AttrDict.
